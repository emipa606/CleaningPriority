    --- Original Description ---
A mod that lets you arbitrarily pick which area pawns clean first and which area pawns clean last.

When colonists start cleaning in vanilla Rimworld, they clean the closest dirt they can reach. If you want to get them to clean a really important room first, you would need to either manually prioritize jobs or restrict a colonist to the room. Both ways are full of micromanagement and hassle.

Using this mod, you can use a menu to prioritize certain areas (allowed areas made using the area manager) for cleaning. Cleaning pawns will always clean filth in the highest priority area that has filth. Click the broom icon on the bottom right of the screen to access this menu.

You can choose to not have the home area as an area where colonists can clean, and you can assign it any priority like it was any other area.

You must have at least one area assigned for cleaning. You can pick any area as the sole area where colonists will clean. If the only assigned cleaning area is deleted, then the home area is assigned as a cleaning area.

If you find any incompatibilities or bugs, please report them.
